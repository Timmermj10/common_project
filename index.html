            <p>
                Sofie is a 15-year-old Beagle mix. Her favorite spot in the house is the living room couch. She loves to
                go outside, sometimes too much, leaving us to open the door for her constantly. Sofie loves freshly cut
                grass, she rolls around in it for hours after it gets cut.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sofie is very old, she joined our family when I was still in a car seat. Sofie loves the weekends
                because she gets her favorite treat, a fried egg. Sofie loves long walks around the lake or on the
                trail, where she can be let free to run to her hearts content.
            </p>

            <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width="400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>
                Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different
                beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as
                he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to
                admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.
            </p>
            <p>
                At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
                ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.
            </p>

            <img src="images/biscuit1.jpeg" alt="Shiba inu sitting in front of pond with stones in the background"

            <p>
                Biscuit is a 2 year old shiba inu dog. Shiba inus are energetic and playful dogs. Biscuit enjoys running
                outside in circles and then laying down in the grass in the sun for hours. He also likes going for
                occasional swims.
            </p>

            <p>
                As energetic as Biscuit is, he also likes to relax. He loves to sleep in his dog bed and watch Netflix
                with his owners. His favorite treat is apples.
            </p>
